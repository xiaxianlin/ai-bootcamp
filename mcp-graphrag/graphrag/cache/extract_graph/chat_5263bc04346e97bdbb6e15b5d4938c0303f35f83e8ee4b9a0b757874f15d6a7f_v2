度，而C4.5也是目前最为通用的决策树模型的一般框架，后续尽管有其他的决策树\n模型诞生，但大都是在C4.5的基本流程上进行略微调整或者指标修改，甚至在C4.5还被\nIEEE评为10大数据挖掘算法之首，由此可见C4.5算法的巨大影响力。此外，由于C4.5开源\n时间较早，这也使得在过去的很长一段时间内，C4.5都是最通用的决策树算法。当然在此\n后，Ross Quinlan又公布了C5.0算法，进一步优化了运行效率和预测流程，通过一系列数\n据结构的调整使得其能够更加高效的利用内存、并提高执行速度。当然，由于C5.0在很长\n的一段时间是作为收费软件存在、并且多集成与像SAS软件中，因此并未被最广泛的应用\n于各领域。\n此外，值得一提的是，由于Ross Quinlan拥有非常深厚的数学背景，因此在设计决策\n树算法的时候，尽管决策树是一种非参数方法（无需提前进行数据训练的假设检验），但\n在实际执行决策树剪枝（一种防止过拟合的手段）时却需要用到非常多统计学方法，在实\n际构建模型时也无需划分训练集和测试集，因此C4.5其实更像是一种统计学算法，而非机\n器学习算法。\n需要知道的是，C4.5在树的生长上还是更像机器学习算法，而这种半“统计\n学”半“机器学习”的状态也是该算法存在争议的地方。\nCART决策树\nCART全称为Classification and Regression Trees，即分类与回归决策树，同时也被\n称为C&RT算法，在1984年由Breiman、Friedman、Olshen和Stone四人共同提出。\nCART树和C4.5决策树的构造过程非常类似，但拓展了回归类问题的计算流程（此前C4.5\n只能解决分类问题），并且允许采用更丰富的评估指标来指导建模流程，并且，最关键的\n是，CART算法其实是一个非常典型的机器学习算法，在早期CART树的训练过程中，就是\n通过划分训练集和验证集（或者测试集）来验证模型结果、并进一步据此来调整模型结\n构，当然，除此以外，CART树还能够用一套流程同时处理离散变量和连续变量、能够同\n时处理分类问题和回归问题，这些都符合一个机器学习领域要求算法有更普适的功能和更\n强的鲁棒性的要求，这也是为何近几年CART树会更加流行的主要原因。当然，在skelarn\n中，决策树模型评估器集成的也是CART树模型，稍后我们在介绍决策树建模流程的时候\n也将主要介绍CART树的建模流程。\n此处我们也可以参考sklearn中对于ID3、C4.5和CART树的对比描述：\n1\n需要注意的是，sklearn中也并非实现的是完全的CART树，通过相关评估器\n参数的调整，sklearn中也能实现“CART树的建模流程+C4.5的决策树生长\n指标”这种混合模型。\n此外，与其说CART树是一个非常“机器学习”的算法，不如说CART树是一个\n更加适合使用机器学习的方法来进行建模的模型，机器学习或者统计学建模\n方法更大程度上是一种建模思路，很多模型（像逻辑回\n######################\nOutput:",

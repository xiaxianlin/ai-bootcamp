ent_B\n0.24674981977443922\n而该结果也被称为根据age列进行数据集划分后的信息增益（information gain），上述结果可写成\nGain(age) = 0.247\n当然，至此我们只计算了按照age列的不同取值来进行数据集划分后数据集不纯度下降结果，而按照\nage列进行展开只能算是树的第一步生长中的一个备选划分规则，此外我们还需要测试按照income、\nstudent或者credit_rating列展开后数据集不纯度下降情况，具体计算过程和age列展开后的计算过程类\n似，此处直接给出结果，Gain(income)=0.026、Gain(student)=0.151、Gain(credit_rating)=0.048。很\n明显，按照age列展开能够更有效的降低数据集的不纯度，因此树的第一层生长就是按照age列的不同取\n值对数据集进行划分。\n接下来需要继续进行迭代，通过观察我们不难发现，对于数据集B1来说来说，按照student这一列来\n进行展开，能够让子节点的信息熵归零，而数据集B2按照如果按照credit_rating来展开，也同样可以将\n子节点的标签纯度提高至100%。因此该模型最终树的生长形态如下：\n至此，我们就完成了ID3决策树的建模全流程，具体模型结果解读和CART树完全一样，此处不做赘\n述。接下来简单对比ID3和CART树之间的差异：首先，由于ID3是按照列来提取规则、每次展开一列，因\n此每一步生长会有几个分支，其实完全由当前列有几个分类水平决定，而CART树只能进行二叉树的生\n长；其次，由于ID3每次展开一列，因此建模过程中对“列的消耗”非常快，数据集中特征个数就决定了树\n的最大深度，相比之下CART树的备选规则就要多的多，这也使得CART树能够进行更加精细的规则提\n取；当然，尽管CART树和ID3存在着基本理论层面的差异，但有的时候也能通过CART树的方法来挖掘出\n和ID3决策树相同的规律，例如ID3中按照age列一层展开所提取出的三个分类规则，也可以在CART树中\n通过两层树来实现，例如第一层按照是否是<=30来进行划分、第二层围绕不满足第一层条件的数据集进\n一步根据是否>40来进行划分。\n\n此外，需要注意的是，正因为ID3是按照列来进行展开，因此只能处理特征都是离散变量的数据集。\n另外，根据ID3的建模规则我们不难发现，ID3树在实际生长过程中会更倾向于挑选取值较多的分类变量\n展开，但如此一来便更加容易造成模型过拟合，而遗憾的是ID3并没有任何防止过拟合的措施。而这些\nID3的缺陷，则正是C4.5算法的改进方向。接下来我们继续讨论关于C4.5决策树的建模规则。\n当然，对于ID3来说，规则是和分类变量的取值一一绑定的，\n二、C4.5决策树的基本建模流程\n作为ID3的改进版算法，C4.5在ID3的基础上进行了三个方面的优化，首先在衡量不纯度降低的数值\n计算过程中引入信息值（information value，也被称为划分信息度、分支度等）概�\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_300c15c215c3d63c05ff7f39e4bff68863466d1fde578f12c9fd2ba4a7c97386_v2"}

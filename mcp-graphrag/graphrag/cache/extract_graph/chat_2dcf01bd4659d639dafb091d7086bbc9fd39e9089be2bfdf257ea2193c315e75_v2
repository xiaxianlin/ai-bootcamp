Supported criteria\nare \"mse\" for the mean squared error, which is equal to variance\nreduction as feature selection criterion and minimizes the L2 loss\nusing the mean of each terminal node, \"friedman_mse\", which uses mean\nsquared error with Friedman's improvement score for potential splits,\nand \"mae\" for the mean absolute error, which minimizes the L1 loss\nusing the median of each terminal node.\n.. versionadded:: 0.18\nMean Absolute Error (MAE) criterion.\nsplitter : {\"best\", \"random\"}, default=\"best\"\nThe strategy used to choose the split at each node. Supported\nstrategies are \"best\" to choose the best split and \"random\" to choose\nthe best random split.\nmax_depth : int, default=None\nThe maximum depth of the tree. If None, then nodes are expanded until\nall leaves are pure or until all leaves contain less than\nmin_samples_split samples.\nmin_samples_split : int or float, default=2\nThe minimum number of samples required to split an internal node:\n- If int, then consider `min_samples_split` as the minimum number.\n- If float, then `min_samples_split` is a fraction and\n`ceil(min_samples_split * n_samples)` are the minimum\nnumber of samples for each split.\n.. versionchanged:: 0.18\nAdded float values for fractions.\nmin_samples_leaf : int or float, default=1\nThe minimum number of samples required to be at a leaf node.\nA split point at any depth will only be considered if it leaves at\n\nleast ``min_samples_leaf`` training samples in each of the left and\nright branches. This may have the effect of smoothing the model,\nespecially in regression.\n- If int, then consider `min_samples_leaf` as the minimum number.\n- If float, then `min_samples_leaf` is a fraction and\n`ceil(min_samples_leaf * n_samples)` are the minimum\nnumber of samples for each node.\n.. versionchanged:: 0.18\nAdded float values for fractions.\nmin_weight_fraction_leaf : float, default=0.0\nThe minimum weighted fraction of the sum total of weights (of all\nthe input samples) required to be at a leaf node. Samples have\nequal weight when sample_weight is not provided.\nmax_features : int, float or {\"auto\", \"sqrt\", \"log2\"}, default=None\nThe number of features to consider when looking for the best split:\n- If int, then consider `max_features` features at each split.\n- If float, then `max_features` is a fraction and\n`int(max_features * n_features)` features are considered at each\nsplit.\n- If \"auto\", then `max_features=n_features`.\n- If \"sqrt\", then `max_features=sqrt(n_features)`.\n- If \"log2\", then `max_features=log2(n_features)`.\n- If None, then `max_features=n_features`.\nNote: the search for a split does not stop until at least one\nvalid partition of the node samples is found, even if it requires to\neffectively inspect more than ``max_features`` features.\nrandom_state : int, RandomState instance, default=None\nControls the randomness of the estimator. The features are always\nrandomly permuted at each split, even if ``splitter`` is set to\n``\"best\"``. When ``max_features < n_features``, the algorithm will\nselect ``max_features`` at random at each split before finding the best\nsplit among them. But the best found split may vary across different\nruns, even if ``max_features=n_features``. That is the case, if the\nimprovement of the criterion is identical for several splits and one\nsplit has to be selected at random. To obtain a deterministic behaviour\nduring fitting, ``random_state`` has to be fixed to an integer.\nSee :term:`Glossary <random_state>` for details.\nmax_leaf_nodes : int, default=None\nGrow a tree with ``max_leaf_nodes`` in best-first fashion.\nBest nodes are defined as relative reduction in impurity.\nIf None then unlimited number of leaf nodes.\nmin_impurity_decrease : float, default=0.0\nA node will be split if this split induces a decrease of the impurity\ngreater than or equal to this value.\nThe weighted impurity decrease equation is the following::\nN_t / N * (impurity - N_t_R / N_t * right_impurity\n- N_t_L / N_t * left_impurity)\nwhere ``N`` is the total number of samples, ``N_t`` is the number of\n\nsamples at the current node, ``N_t_L`` is the number of samples in the\nleft child, and ``N_t_R`` is the number of samples in the right child.\n``N``, ``N_t``, ``N_t_R`` and ``N_t_L`` all refer to the weighted sum,\nif ``sample_weight`` is passed.\n.. versionadded:: 0.19\nmin_impurity_split : float, (default=0)\nThreshold for early stopping in tree growth. A node will split\nif its impurity is above the threshold, otherwise it is a leaf.\n.. deprecated:: 0.19\n``min_impurity_split`` has been deprecated in favor of\n``min_impurity_decrease`` in 0.19. The default value of\n``min_impurity_split`` has changed from 1e-7 to 0 in 0.23 and it\nwill be removed in 0.25.

ent_B\nIG\n0.24674981977443922\n而IV值为：\nIV = - (5/14 * np.log2(5/14) + 5/14 * np.log2(5/14)+ 4/14 * np.log2(4/14))\nIV\n1.5774062828523454\n因此计算得到GR值为：\nGR = IG / IV\nGR\n0.1564275624211752\n然后据此进一步计算其他各列展开后的GR值，并选择GR较大者进行数据集划分。\n\nC4.5的连续变量处理方法\nC4.5允许带入连续变量进行建模，并且围绕连续变量的规则提取方式和此前介绍的CART树一致。即\n在连续变量中寻找相邻的取值的中间点作为备选切分点\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_48b187ee56831789df09ee7ce9be46c6f752ffb850c94f9a11b87558256f56da_v2"}

The Gain Ratio, another metric introduced by C4.5, uses Information Value in its calculation. This relationship shows the importance of Information Value in adjusting Information Gain, guiding the selection of variables for splitting. The direct relationship between Information Value and Gain Ratio underlines the significance of Information Value in the C4.5 algorithm's methodology for creating more accurate and generalizable decision trees.

Information Gain itself is a measure used to determine the best feature that maximizes the information gain, or reduction in entropy, from a split on that feature. The Gain Ratio takes this a step further by normalizing the Information Gain using Information Value, thus ensuring that the algorithm does not favor attributes with more levels unnecessarily. This relationship is crucial for the algorithm's ability to select the most informative features while avoiding biases towards features with many levels. The interdependency of Gain Ratio and Information Gain highlights the sophisticated approach of the C4.5 algorithm in handling the challenges of decision tree construction, such as overfitting and the selection of optimal splitting points.
